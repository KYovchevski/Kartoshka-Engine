# Kartoshka Engine
 
Kartoshka engine is a project I have been working on for the past 2 months in my spare time from school. The goal of the project was for me to gain experience with Vulkan and use it as a sandbox for other rendering techniques in the future, such as physically based rendering and animations. I started working on this project with no knowledge of Vulkan, and the final result has been achieved in around 130-140 hours of research and programming.

The final product is capable of rendering Sponza with very few visual glitches, with a single point light whose position and colour can be controled via ImGui. While Sponza is used by the project for showcase, other models and scenes can be loaded from GLTF files. The rendering pipeline ins't advanced, and currently supports only a single point light with normal mapping for the surfaces.
